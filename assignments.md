### Readings

Assigned readings appear in the [course schedule](schedule.html).
Students are expected to complete the reading assignments in advance
of discussion.

### Written article summaries

In advance of the discussion of an article (or articles), write a
short summary: one paragraph describing the article, and a second
paragraph describing your reaction (for example, aspects that you
found surprising, interesting, or suspect). The written summary should
be less than a page but more than a couple of sentences.

These article summaries should be completed at least a half-hour prior
to the class meeting time. This may be accomplished in a variety of
ways. For example:

- Email a PDF or text file to [the instructor](https://kbroman.org).
- Post to a blog, for example with
  [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), [GitHub
  pages](https://pages.github.com/), or [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com).
- Post to a repository at [GitHub](https://github.com) or
  [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org).

For the blog or repository approaches, they should be accessible to
the instructor but could otherwise be private.

Most weeks, there will be only one article summary, due by Tuesday at
8:00am.

### Homework assignments

There will be three written homework assignments
related to the articles under discussion. These homework assignments
will involve an effort to reproduce the results of an article, the use
of computer simulation to investigate properties of methods discussed
in an article, or application of the discussed methods to related
biomedical data.
